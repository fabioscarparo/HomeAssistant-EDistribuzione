# Changelog

## 0.5.0
First release of this fork of
[maurobraggio/HomeAssistant-EDistribuzione](https://github.com/maurobraggio/HomeAssistant-EDistribuzione).

### Added
- F1 / F2 / F3 time bands: three more statistics for the consumption direction
  (`edistribuzione:<pod>_energia_f1`, `_f2`, `_f3`), calculated from the 15-minute samples
  with the ARERA holiday calendar (October 4 included from 2026). Hour by hour they add up to
  the total, cover all the history already downloaded and follow corrections on their own.
- *POD card* (`custom:edistribuzione-pod-card`): consumption, return to grid and the F1/F2/F3
  split in day, week, month and year views, with Home Assistant's own look in light and dark
  mode. The integration loads it by itself, with no resource to add.
- Italian and English translations: entity names, setup and options, actions and error
  messages follow each user's language.
- Integration icon in Home Assistant, from version 2026.3.
- A notice in *Settings > Repairs* when E-Distribuzione blocks automated access with its
  anti-bot check; it disappears on its own once access works again.

### Changed
- README in English, with a step-by-step guide to setup, history import and checks.

### Fixed
- Sensors missing until a restart when E-Distribuzione did not answer while Home Assistant
  was starting.
- When E-Distribuzione answers with its anti-bot check, setup no longer fails with the generic
  "cannot connect" error and updates no longer log an unexpected error: the integration
  reports the block and retries once an hour.
